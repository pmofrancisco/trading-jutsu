/**
 * Where each window starts, as the unit `date_trunc` truncates the newest bar
 * to. This is the whole definition of a period: the queries take the units from
 * here rather than naming any one of them, so another window is this record and
 * the union behind it, not another block of SQL.
 *
 * Postgres truncates a week to the Monday, so the week-to-date cut-off is the
 * Monday of the newest bar's week and the level it measures from is the last bar
 * before it — the previous Friday's close in a full trading week.
 *
 * Shared rather than owned by one query because two of them now ask the same
 * question of different symbols: `index-performance` prices the seven indices
 * over these windows, and `period-leaders` ranks the stocks over them. A window
 * defined in two places is two definitions that drift the first time one is
 * retuned.
